# xCam - Virtual Camera Xposed Module

**xCam** is a modern Xposed module designed to replace the physical camera feed with a virtual media source (images or videos). It is specifically optimized for Android 9+ and applications using the Camera2 API (including CameraX).

## 🚀 Features

- **Universal Support**: Works with both legacy **Camera1** and modern **Camera2** APIs.
- **Image & Video Support**: Use `.mp4` videos or `.jpg`/`.png` images as your camera source.
- **Horizontal Mirroring**: Toggle mirroring to match the front-facing camera's expected behavior.
- **Auto-Rotation Correction**: Automatically forces a portrait orientation to prevent your media from appearing sideways.
- **Robust Injection**: 
    - **Videos**: Streamed via `MediaPlayer` using manual `AssetFileDescriptor` management.
    - **Images**: Rendered via a dedicated background thread for high stability.
- **Internal Storage Import**: Automatically copies media to internal storage to bypass Android URI permission restrictions.
- **Modern Material 3 UI**: Full support for Dynamic Colors and a clean, visual management interface.
- **Live Preview**: See a thumbnail of your active media and the effect of mirroring directly in the manager app.

## 🛠 Prerequisites
